# Guess Win DSA Project : 1
Make a C++ program called Guess & Win. In this game: A Guesser chooses a secret number. Three Players each guess a number. An Umpire collects all numbers and compares them.
The Umpire decides who wins:
If a player’s number matches the Guesser’s number → that player wins.
If more than one player matches → those players win together.
If nobody matches → all players lose.
