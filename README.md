# Guess-Win-DSA-Project
This project is a console-based interactive game where:  A Guesser selects a secret number.  Three Players each try to guess the number.  An Umpire collects all guesses, compares them, and declares the winners.  The game can be extended to multiple rounds, different numbers of players, and advanced features like score tracking.
